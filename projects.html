                <h3><a href="https://github.com/pvstark/art-blog-landing-page">Poetry Blog Site:</a></h3>
                <p>This is a website I am designing to house my partner's poetry they have written. Features of the site I'm currently working on include creating object files for each poem with title, text of the poem, and tags for content and themes.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/pvstark/correct-the-html">Correct the HTML Code:You Assignment</a></h3>
                <p>This assignment from the Code:You program was meant to demonstrate proficiency with GitHub's version control and the ability to go through existing code and make improvements, skills highly necessary in professional environments.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/pvstark/text_file_creator">Text File Creator</a></h3>
                <p>This repo, also from a Code:You assignment demonstrates familiarity with Python to take user inputs and utilize them to create a text document. While my focus is on web development, this assignment does show an example of some basic proficiency with other aspects of software development beyond markup languages.</p>

                <p>This project demonstrates my skills with APIs through Code:You, though it is not functional out-of-the-box because I have better opsec than to upload my Unsplash API key.</p>
