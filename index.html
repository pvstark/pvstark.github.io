            I am a former retail expert looking to change fields, either to administrative work or to something in tech.
            I've studied web development from the Code:You program in Kentucky, though I am relocating to northern Colorado. Throughout
            everything I've done and everywhere I've worked, my goal has always been to be a voice for those who need it most. While in
            Louisville, KY, I was active with the local chapter of the DSA, attending events and engaging with the community to help the 
            homeless, LGBTQIA+ folks,and other groups who need our help now more than ever.
